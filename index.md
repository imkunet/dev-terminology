# dev-terminology
The ever-growing list of terminology that programmers use. (Using Ctrl/Cmd-F is recommended.)


### AOT (adv.)
Ahead of time; specifically, usually refers to programs that are compiled to machine-code before they are run, as opposed to JIT programs which are compiled as they are run.

### Boolean
A value that may either be true or false.

### Programming Language (noun)
A specified syntax which may be used to create programs. "Specified" refers to the fact that languages tend to have a formal specification which defines the set of possible valid programs. A formal specification usually refers to some sort of document or website that defines correct behavior; however, a compiler may also be considered a specification, but this can become confusing since compilers are usually implemented for languages (which usually specify correct behavior independently of their compilers).

Sometimes refer to an implementation/compiler of a language, but it is not recommended to use this term as so in a formal context.
